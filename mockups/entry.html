        <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>

        <p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Do an almighty painting with us. See there, told you that would be easy. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>

        <p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.</p>

        <p>Now then, let's play. In life you need colors. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>

        <p>Be brave. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.</p>

        <p>Let's get wild today. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. We can fix anything.</p>

        <p>A beautiful little sunset. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>
